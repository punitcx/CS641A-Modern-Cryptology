This bibliography style file is generated via the `urlbst` package, with various customizations by Michael Forbes, Prahladh Harsha and Ramprasad Saptharishi. The hope is to have a bibliography style, and some associated macros, that allows people to generate a more useful bibliography with little effort. Here are some of the things that the current bst file does. 

 * If there is a doi link, or a url field in a bibitem, the title of the paper is made a hyperlink pointing to the doi/url (doi preferred). 
 * If there is an eccc field or an eprint field, it adds a new block in the bibliography that says that a preprint is available at arXiv/ECCC (arXiv preferred)
 * Various macros in `bibmacros.tex` help in having a systematic presentation of various conferences etc.
